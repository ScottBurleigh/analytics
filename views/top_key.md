The top chart shows the monthly median weekday visitors for the site.

In the table

- The table is ordered by the recent median
- The recent median is the median daily page views over the last five weekdays
- The median (awkwardly named) is the median daily page views of the last complete month
- The total is the total page views for the last complete month
- The prior rank is the rank according the median daily page views of the last complete month
- The history sparkline is the of monthly median weekday page views  

The awkward naming is due to some implementation short-cuts that I will get around to changing some day.
